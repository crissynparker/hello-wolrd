# hello-wolrd


Hi humans


Christina here, I like learning new things. People, places and things.I love Kids, people who like kids, and movies.
Coffee is my energy, the sunshine is my norish, and the rain is my ease to my soul.
I live in Seattle, but from small town Covington. which has rapidly grown from cow pastures to neighborhoods.
