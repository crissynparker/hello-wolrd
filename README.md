Hi humans
Christina here! Welcome to my profile. And start to softwear engineering. I was a driver for amazon, who came from cooking in restarants, delivering for them, and now working in a grocery store. Im ready for anew change.
I like learning new things.I love Kids, people who like kids, and movies. 
Coffee is my energy, the sunshine is my norish, and the rain is my ease to my soul.
