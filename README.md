# hello-wolrd


Hi humans
Christina here! I was a driver for amazon, who came from cooking in restarants, delivering for them, and now working in a grocery store. Im ready for anew change.
I like learning new things.I love Kids, people who like kids, movies and ruby red. 
Coffee is my energy, the sunshine is my norish, and the rain is my ease to my soul.
